Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software Engineering is a systematic application of engineering whereby it involves a systematic approach to designing, developing and maintaining software systems. It differs from traditional engineering as it involves applying engineering principles to the entire software development process from conception to maintenance. Traditional Engineering, on the othe hand, lacks the comprehensive, structured methodology of software engineering as it focuses mainly on writing code to solve specific tasks.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
There are several phases found in the software development life circle. The include; 

Requirement Analysis: This involves the collection of the customers’ requirements and potential of acceptance in order to determine what needs to be done by the software.

Design: This involves developing a plan of where the system should be built and how it should be built and what its component should do when it is built.

Implementation (Coding): Involves generating the actual code that was designed based on the design documents that was generated.

Testing: This ensures that the software functions properly and meets the client’s requirements without any mistake or flaw.

Deployment: Putting the software into the hands of the users and actually deploying it in their usage.

Maintenance: Accommodating and resolving any changes or errors that may occur with the software once installed and used to meet the users’ and organizational requirements.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Agile Model is an iterative process in terms of its approach where development is carried out in cycles that are commonly called sprints. Whereas waterfall model is linear and Sequential in that phases must be sequential in the sense that one has to be fully executed before the next phase is initiated.
Agile Model is Flexible and Adaptive. This means one can alter the content despite being deep into development. While Waterfall Model is Less Flexible it is expensive to implement change when in the project phase as compared to when the project is in its initial phase.
Agile Model involves the customers by getting feedbacks from them ensuring the the product meets their needs while Waterfall Model has defined requirements. 
Agile Model is  preferrable for projects with flexibility, frequent changes, customer input for instance, startups, Web applications
Waterfall Model is best suited for projects with clear specifications and frequently experience low change e.g. construction projects

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering  is the process of establishing software requirements, expressing them and maintaining them. It involves:
Elicitation: Identifying the requirements of the stakeholders with the help of interview sessions, questionnaire and other forms of observations.
Analysis: The process of breaking requirements up into its components so as to ensure that the requirements are well-satisfied, practical, and understood.
Specification: Recording the requirement specifications in adherence to technical writing formats.
Validation: The requirements meet the identified needs of the stakeholders and can be met effectively by the organization.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
The concept of Modularity in software development involves dividing a software system into separate components or modules, each responsible for a specific functionality. This enables it to improve maintainability making it easier to update and fix individual modules without affecting the entire system, scalability whereby new features can be added as new modules without disrupting existing ones and lastly reusability whereby modules can be reused in different projects or parts of the same project.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Unit Testing: The exercise of checking and verifying a smaller or incremental portion of the whole system such as parts of a program or a single instruction.
Integration Testing: Evaluating the converter input and output interfaces between integrated units to confirm whether or not interfaces contain defects.
System Testing: A procedure of validating a complete system to ensure that it has been developed according to what was required.
Acceptance Testing: Confirming the system with the needs and specifications of user/frequently requires the end-users to bring their input.
Testing is crucial in software development in that the testing process enables one to find and correct the defects that a software might contain in order to guarantee quality

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version Control Systems are mechanisms used to manage changes that developers make to code in real time. They are important because they allow a project to roll back to a previous version and keep records of changes.
Examples:
Git: Distributed VCS that has been built for branching and other collaboration-related aspects.
Subversion: In centralized VCS, the primary features are optimized for easy operation and efficient version management.
Version Control Systems are used for tracking the changes, collaboration, as well as ensuring integrity of the code.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
Software Project Manager observes the schedule and coordinates all aspects of developing software projects. Key responsibilities include:
Project Planning: Identification and confirmation of deliverables, schedule, and cost parameters.
Team Management: Overseeing senior and junior team members and coordinatiing the team of developers.
Risk Management: Potential risks: current challenges in assessing the potential risks and the factors that should be taken into consideration when mitigating the identified risks are the main issues that should be addressed.
Communication: Fostering communication between the inception of ideas, implementation and those who would be using it.
Some of the challenges enclosed working on the project include; Scope Creep: This involves handling additional work that may have not originally been planned in the project Management Deadlines: This involves efficiently meeting set project deadlines . Quality Vs Speed: This involves balancing between the level of quality delivered in a project and the time taken to deliver the project.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Software Maintenance refers to the process of maintaining and enhancing software after it has been released. The different types of maintenance activities include; 
Corrective Maintenance which Corrects errors and malfunctions.
Adaptive maintenance which is adapting software to changing surroundings, such as new operating systems 
Perfective Maintenance which is Improving performance and functionality.
Preventive Maintenance that involves the Increasing maintainability to avert problems later on.
Software maintenance is essential beacause it guarantees that the software stays efficient, current, and functional over time.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Privacy: Making sure that user information is safe and not exploited.
Security is the process of creating safe software to fend off intrusions and attacks.
Intellectual property: Observing licenses and copyrights.
Fairness and prejudice: Preventing prejudice in algorithms and making sure software is usable by everyone.
By adhering to industry codes of conduct, carrying out exhaustive testing, and keeping stakeholders informed, engineers can uphold ethical standards.
